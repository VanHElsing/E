.SH DESCRIPTION
e_axfilter 1.8\-001 "Gopaldhara"
.PP
This problem applies SinE\-like goal\-directed filters to a problem
specification to generate reduced problem specifications that are easier
to handle for the prover, but still are likely to contain the necessary
axioms for a proof (if one exists). The program reads a problem
specification and a filter specification, and produces one reduced
specifiation for each filter given. Note that while all input
formats (LOP, TPTP\-2 and TPTP\-3 are supported, output is only and
automatically supported in TPTP\-3, and the default input format is
TPTP\-3. Also note that unlike most of the other tools in the E
distribution, this program does not support pipe\-based input and output,
since it uses file names generated from the input file name and filter
names to store the different result files
.SH OPTIONS

.HP
\fB\-h\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print a short description of program usage and options.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug
reports (if any).
.HP
\fB\-v\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-verbose[=\fR<arg>]
.IP
Verbose comments on the progress of the program. This differs from the
output level (below) in that technical information is printed to stderr,
while the output level determines which logical manipulations of the
clauses are printed to stdout. The short form or the long form without
the optional argument is equivalent to \fB\-\-verbose\fR=\fI1\fR.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<arg>
.IP
Redirect output into the named file (this affects only some output, as
most is written to automatically generated files based on the input and
filter names.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-output\-level\fR=\fI0\fR.
.HP
\fB\-l\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-level=\fR<arg>
.IP
Select an output level, greater values imply more verbose output.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <arg>
.HP
\fB\-\-filter=\fR<arg>
.IP
Specify the filter definition file. If not set, the system will uses the
built\-in default.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-dump\-filter\fR
.IP
Print the filter definition in force.
.HP
\fB\-\-lop\-in\fR
.IP
Parse input in E\-LOP, not the default TPTP\-3 format.
.HP
\fB\-\-lop\-format\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-lop\-in\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-tptp\-in\fR
.IP
Parse TPTP\-2 format instead of E\-LOP (but note that includes are handled
according to TPTP\-3 semantics).
.HP
\fB\-\-tptp\-format\fR
.IP
Equivalent to \fB\-\-tptp\-in\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-tptp2\-in\fR
.IP
Synonymous with \fB\-\-tptp\-in\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-tptp2\-format\fR
.IP
Synonymous with \fB\-\-tptp\-in\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-tstp\-in\fR
.IP
Parse TPTP\-3 format instead of E\-LOP (Note that TPTP\-3 syntax is still
under development, and the version in E may not be fully conforming at
all times. E works on all TPTP 5.4.0 FOF and CNF input files (including
includes).
.HP
\fB\-\-tstp\-format\fR

Equivalent to \fB\-\-tstp\-in\fR.
